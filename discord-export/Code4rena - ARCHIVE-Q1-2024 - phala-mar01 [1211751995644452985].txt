The audit page on the site is missing, has this contest been cancelled/moved?

Sorry, we've never built it on Windows. It is recommend to build it on macOS or Ubuntu, then you can `apt install libcang-dev` it the error still there.

[03/03/2024 19:06] koolexc
With vs code you mean? The extension?


[03/03/2024 19:07] 0xarsi
Yeah


[03/03/2024 19:07] koolexc
If so, yes. Often, it takes forever to recognize functions, mods... etc


[03/03/2024 19:07] koolexc
I don't know how to fix it. It was working.. Few minutes later, it stopped


[03/03/2024 19:07] koolexc
Found any workaround?


[03/03/2024 19:07] 0xarsi
Yeah it was also working for me briefly then just stopped


[03/03/2024 19:08] koolexc
On Mac?


[03/03/2024 19:08] 0xarsi
WSL


[03/03/2024 19:08] koolexc
Seems a bug in the extension..


[03/03/2024 19:08] 0xarsi
I tried rebuilding and also tweaking rust analyzer settings but nothing worked


[03/03/2024 19:09] 0xarsi
Maybe, but it recognized substrate related stuff in a different project for me


[03/03/2024 19:09] 0xarsi
It’s not even doing that for this one and I’m not sure why


[03/03/2024 19:09] koolexc
That's weird


[03/03/2024 19:09] koolexc
This all in vs code right?


[03/03/2024 19:09] 0xarsi
Yeah all in vscode. Do you use the rust-analyzer.linkedProjects setting by any chance?


[03/03/2024 19:10] koolexc
I didn't try to change any setting


[03/03/2024 19:10] 0xarsi
Oh ok


[03/03/2024 19:10] koolexc
Try to disable enable the ext?


[03/03/2024 19:10] 0xarsi
Does your rust analyzer error out or does it just seem like it worked but nothing is recognized


[03/03/2024 19:11] 0xarsi
Yeah I might disable/reenable or reload it


[03/03/2024 19:11] koolexc
Yeah, it seem it worked but nothing is happening


[03/03/2024 19:11] 0xarsi
Ah ok yeah I have the same issue even after specifying the Cargo.toml files to the settings


[03/03/2024 19:12] koolexc
There is this bar loader on the top , it shows it's trying to do its job.. But it stays like this forever


[03/03/2024 19:12] 0xarsi
Oh that’s odd


[03/03/2024 19:12] 0xarsi
I don’t have that


[03/03/2024 19:12] koolexc
I kinda gave up on it.. Any other extension as an alternative?


[03/03/2024 19:13] koolexc
Any idea?


[03/03/2024 19:28] 0xarsi
When the analyzer is building/checking can you see it checking/building/indexing each pallet or crate?


[03/03/2024 19:30] koolexc
Only in the beginning yes, in the bottom bar


[03/03/2024 19:31] 0xarsi
Yeah I have the same thing but once it’s done it does not load any definitions for anything lol


[03/03/2024 19:33] 0xarsi
It works for me for other substrate projects/ solana projects so this is some proj specific issue idk what tho


[03/03/2024 19:34] 0xarsi
@Hang - Phala any ideas on how to fix this?


[03/03/2024 20:06] h4x3rotab
Rust analyzer is generally slow. Especially, our project has large dependencies. I’d suggest to not rely on code suggestions. If you like to see the doc, you can try “cargo doc --document-private-items”


[03/03/2024 20:06] h4x3rotab
Do you see any warnings or errors from rust analyzer?


[03/03/2024 20:08] h4x3rotab
Also, give “cargo check” a try since it creates at least the debug build artifacts. Not sure if it accelerates the rust analyzer loading, but I see when rust analyzer finished, it produces the debug artifacts inside the target dir

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/03/2024 20:09] 0xarsi
regarding this, i got it to work by deleting the target dir, letting rust analyzer build once, then i added the following settings in my `.vscode/settings.json` so it only runs cargo check instead of building every time
```
{
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.buildScripts.enable": false,
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.buildScripts.rebuildOnSave": false,
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave": true,
    "rust-analyzer.inlayHints.parameterHints.enable": true,
    "rust-analyzer.procMacro.enable": true,
    "rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [
        "/path/to/project/root/cargo/toml/file",
    ]
}
```

by the way is the code in scope the exact same as the code in the phala blockchain repo? I think it said this in the readme but just wanted to confirm that it's identical to the code in scope in the bigger repo

I wrote a simple contract that uses is_in_transaction in a function. I uploaded this contract in a test in crates/pink/runtime/tests/test_pink_contract.rs using cluster.tx().upload_code(). However, when I call the function that uses is_in_transaction with cluster.tx().call_typed, this function always returns false. Shouldn't it actually be true since I sent a transaction to the contract? @Hang - Phala


[03/11/2024 22:46] theschnilch
I've found out that it's not because of the runtime. It looks more like the return value is somehow not being decoded correctly
